Permission modes let you decide once what Claude is allowed to run without stopping to ask you. Instead of approving every action one prompt at a time, you pick a mode that matches the job and let Claude work at the level of trust you're comfortable with.
## The six permission modes

Here's the full set. Each mode draws a different line between what runs freely and what needs your sign-off.

- **Manual** reads only, without prompting. Everything else asks first.
- **Accept edits** runs reads, file edits, and common file system bash commands without asking. This is for iterating on code that you review after the fact.
- **Plan** reads only. It researches and proposes changes without editing anything.
- **Auto** accepts everything, with a separate classifier model reviewing each action before it runs.
- **Don't ask** allows only pre-approved tools. Everything else is auto-denied with no prompt.
- **Bypass permissions** skips all checks. This is the equivalent of the dangerously-skip-permissions flag. Only run it inside an isolated container or virtual machine.
## How auto mode works

Auto is the hands-off mode. Claude runs on its own, but before each action executes, a separate classifier model reviews it. The classifier guards intent. It's watching for moves that escalate beyond what you actually asked for.

Here's the kind of thing it's designed to block:

- Production deploys and migrations
- Force pushing, or piping downloaded code straight into a shell
- Sending sensitive data to external endpoints
- Destroying files that exist for the session

And it waves through the everyday work: local edits in your project, installing dependencies from your lock file, read-only requests, and pushing to your own branch.
### What the classifier can't do

The classifier checks intent, not correctness. It won't catch whether the code actually works. So if you ask Claude to refactor authentication and it writes broken authentication, the classifier waves it through, because broken isn't dangerous.

That's why you pair auto mode with a stop hook that runs your tests. The two work together:

- Auto mode watches what Claude is _trying_ to do while it runs.
- The stop hook confirms the code actually runs once Claude finishes.

One guards intent before each action, the other guards correctness after. Auto mode's guardrails are still evolving, so check the docs for the current block and allow lists.
